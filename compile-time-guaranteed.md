# Build & Run

- Compile

^ To begin with, let's take a look at the usual flow of building and running any application.
^ First - we want the compiler to transform our code into something a CPU can interpret, this is a compilation step.

---

# Build & Run

- ‚úÖ Compile
- Link

^ After that is done, linker uses the code that we compiled and links it with all the frameworks that we've used, packages all the compiled code into a single binary, as well as packages our code.

---

# Build & Run

- ‚úÖ Compile
- ‚úÖ Link
- Run

^ After all of the above, we can finally run our application. Yay!


---

# Build & Run

- ‚úÖ Compile
- ‚úÖ Link
- ‚úÖ Run

^ People are happily using your app, developers are building something amazing using your library.
But...

---

# Build & Run

- ‚úÖ Compile
- ‚úÖ Link
- ‚úÖ Run
- ‚ùå Crash

^ That's not usually what happens.

# Build & Run

- ‚úÖ Compile
- ‚úÖ Link
- ‚úÖ Run
- ‚ùå Crash

^ If everything would be so simple, we would spare so much time.
In most of the cases - our app crashes, or provides some crazy inconsistent behavior.
Why does it happen?

# We are Human!

> My brain tells me the truth, and it can't find any errors, therefore I have written perfect software.
-- Zed A. Shaw

^ Single sentence, don't talk over it for a long time...

---

# Solution?

---

# Test all the things!

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Monkey
- Manual
- Dogfooding üê∂
- ...

^ One of the solutions to automate our reasoning about how our software behaves is to write tests.
There are all different ways and types you write tests, things like Unit, Integration, E2E, Monkey, Manual, Dogfooding...
All these are expensive, and time-consuming efforts that sadly not a lot of people put time in.

# Pyramid of Testing

^If we take a look at our pyramid of testing (I am sure you are familiar with this graphic from before).
Turns out - there is one piece here that is missing, or rather it's implicit.

---

# Pyramid of Testing (Extended)

![inline](Resources/pyramid01.png)

^Compiler! It's right there! The easiest, as well as the biggest source of guarantees for how our software runs.

- Logic
- Variables
- Access Control
- Semantic Analysis
